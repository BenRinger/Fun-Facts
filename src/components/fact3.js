            <h1>What happened to Miranda</h1>
            <p>One of the most bizarre moons in the outer solar system is Miranda, a shadowy moon of Uranus observed only once when Voyager 2 got a glimpse in 1986. Miranda hosts sharp ridges, craters and other major disruptions on its surface that would usually be the result of volcanic action. Tectonic activity could cause that kind of surface, but Miranda is much too small to generate that kind of heat on its own. Researchers think that gravitational pull from Uranus could have generated the push-pull action needed to heat, churn and contort Miranda's surface. But to know for sure, we'll need to send another spacecraft to check out the moon's unobserved northern hemisphere. </p>
